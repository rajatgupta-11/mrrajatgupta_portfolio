### About me
I’m a **mechanical systems engineer** focused on robots and systems that move, adapt, and operate autonomously in the real world. My work sits at the intersection of **mechanics, control theory, and computation** — I care about system-level behavior: how dynamics, sensing, actuation, and control interact under real constraints.

I enjoy **designing, simulating, building, breaking, and refining** systems until their behavior matches intent. I’m motivated by failure-driven learning and I thrive in high-ownership environments that value autonomy and rapid prototyping.

### What I work on
- **Robotics & autonomy**: multi-DOF mechanisms, UAV dynamics, control, and integration
- **Modeling & simulation**: system dynamics, stability, simulation-first iteration
- **Controls**: classical control + practical tuning, robustness, and constraints
- **Hands-on prototyping**: fast iteration with real hardware and real data
